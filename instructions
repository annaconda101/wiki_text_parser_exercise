PHP test:

Design a basic PHP based text parser which translates some wikipedia-like
markup into HTML. Wikipedia markup looks like this:

[command|arg1|arg2|...|argN]

We need only to translate two markups:

1. Articles
=================

[Article|id|optional alternative headline]

'Article' is a command telling us that this is an article link markup. It
should be translated to: <a href="index.php?id=<id from the
command>"><headline, possibly alternative headline></a>



2. Images
====================

[Image|name|caption]

'Image' is a command telling us this is an image. All arguments are
compulsory. It must be translated to:

<img src="im.php?imname=<name>" alt="<caption>" /> Caption: <caption>

Articles we recognise are provided in the following array:

$ARTS = array("1"=>"Ruby the new PHP?", "2"=>"Boring article");

Here, the relationship is id => pre existing headline.

Images we recognise are as follows:

$IMS = array("guitar.jpg", "gavin's new car.jpg", "coffee.jpg");

If an article or image cannot be found or if the markup is malformed, it
should be omitted from the output.




Using these and the rules above, translate the following:

-----

"Another day, another blog entry. Did you see my new
guitar? [Image|guitar.jpg|a guitar]

I found this [Article|1|article] interesting, but this one "[Article|3]"
was more interesting -- actually, it was [Article|2|This one]."
